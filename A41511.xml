            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have been oft (the ſearcher of all hearts knows) in ſome ſuch ſtrait about this preſent Treatiſe, as the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> once reported himſelf to be in, about his particular perſon, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. not knowing whether to deſire its life or death, whether I ſhould let it forth to live in others hands, or to let it lie and die in my own: For verily when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poorneſſe of theſe ſheets, my heart ſhrinks with fear, yet when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the preciouſneſſe of ſouls, my heart ſprings with love, and the unfained love in the Lord I bear to them, makes me deſire this might live with them, though I know the depth of my affection hath here drawn me into a high preſumption. Truly I ſee cauſe to tremble as oft as I think what hazzards I run in putting out this little weak Boat of mine to ſea, and
<pb facs="tcp:106805:5"/> that in a tempeſtuous ſeaſon, when the windes are ſtrong and high, the waters are rough and deep, eſpecially where I am to paſſe: For matters that concern the Sacraments are ſuch as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. About them there is now great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In them there is ever great intricacy.</p>
            <p>As for Sacraments, there are mighty Myſteries in them, and mighty Miſtakes about them, and that in this diſcerning age, wherein is knowledge that leads to truth, and yet ignorance that runs to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. And indeed the meditation of all the ſeverall errours, both in ſpeculative and practicall matters, that now abound, might make a Chriſtians heart like <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> book, to be full of <hi>lamentations, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and woes.</hi> How the peace of places is diſturbed, the paſſage of the Goſpel impeded, the power of godlineſſe abated, and the life of Religion almoſt worn out, and waſted with frivolous and fruitleſſe diſputes, is ſad to ſee: but what contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies are ſo uncomfortable and uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Chriſtians, as thoſe that are now ſtarted up and ſtruggled in touching the two Sacraments and what referres there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Who is ſo blinde bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And above all, Satan ſeeks to divide them with diſcords (according to the old ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation) <hi>in re Sacramentaria,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Sacraments. The ancient Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall battels (if but the breaches between <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) may much affect and affl ct pious and peaceable ſpirits, but the diſputes and debate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that are now in being, about Sacraments are exceeding ſad to conſider. Sacraments are to be bands of union and brotherly unity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.5. O then that about theſe ſhould be ſchiſmes, ſtrifes, contentions, diviſions, and that among perſons profeſſing the fear of God, and faith in Chriſt, muſt needs be dolorous and grievous to every truly tender ſpirit, yet ſo it is. Take both Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord, and (Lord) what differences, diſtances and diſcords about theſe are this day in <hi>England?</hi> For Baptiſm, how doe ſome ſtrive to contract and draw it in ſo narrow, as not to admit any infants, though of Chriſtian parents thereunto? The Lords Supper, it is true, ſome make
<pb facs="tcp:106805:6"/> the confines of it alſo too cloſe, but the moſt part would extend it ſo wide, and open it ſo farre, as to let all men in, though of looſe, lives to partake thereof. The charity of the former is too low and little, the charity of the later too lowd and large, and againſt this I engage, ſo that the great <hi>Goliah</hi> my little <hi>David</hi> in the Name of the Lord is ſent forth to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with, is, ALL TO THE SACRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, and much pleading there is for a univerſall allowance to the Table of the Lord. Books be abroad to this purpoſe: The arguments that ſome urge, I ſuppoſe are but arrows taken out of thoſe quivers, Such darts I have laboured at the leaſt to blunt, and ſuch a promiſcuous liberty I here oppoſe with my poor ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lity, neither am I herein ſingle or ſingular. I reade in the comfortable Notes of <hi>Babington</hi> upon <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.32, 33. <hi>Aaron and his ſons ſhall eat the fleſh of the ramme.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But a ſtranger ſhall not eat thereof, for they are holy things, &amp;c.</hi> That worthy Authour applies this to the Sacrament of the Supper, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no prophane perſon ought to eat thereof: <hi>And yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there are ſome that in our daies (who though they ſeem religious) teach and labour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb facs="tcp:106805:6"/> that wicked ones may as well as others communicate herein, and not only eat and drink bread and wine, but eat the body, and drink the bloud of Chriſt as the godly may, neither will any thing draw them from their violence, not the ſacrifices and figures of the law, nor the pureneſſe and plainneſſe of the Goſpel, but headlong helward they will run with it againſt Scriptures, Fathers, reaſons, and what ever to the contrary ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, As about Sacraments there is now great controverſie, ſo in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments there is ever great intricacy. It was the expreſſion of that learned <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,</hi> that <hi>he had rather hear others, then ſpeak himſelf, concerning either of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, being both ſo full of ſublime Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and profound Myſteries.</hi> And indeed who had not rather land what others bring out of theſe deeps, then lanch out into theſe deeps himſelf? Both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have their dimenſions; yet this of the Supper ſeems to have the higher frame as it ſutes to thoſe who are of the higher form. So that who ever treats aright of this, runs divers difficulties, and who ever goes down into this deep, ſees the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Lord. That which a Papiſt
<pb facs="tcp:106805:7"/> reports of their Sacrament of the Maſſe, that <hi>there are as many myſteries in it, as there are drops in the ſea, duſt on the earth, Angels in heaven, starres in the skie, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes in the ſun-beams, or ſands in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,</hi> &amp;c. A pious and experienced Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant may well aſſert all this of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, celebrated in a ſweet Goſpel-way. O what rocks of pearl, mines of cryſtall, mountains of diamond may we here dig in? A fountain of living water, we may here drink at: The water is good, but the well is deep; the fruit is ſweet, but the tree is high. The world may well wonder at my bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bring forth this ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght bucket to draw water from ſo deep a well, to ſet forth this ſhort ladder, to pluck fruit from ſo high a tree: but having (I hope) oft ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly looked up to God for guidance herein, I have at length reſolved to let this Treatiſe come forth to publike view, upon theſe following grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To anſwer the deſires, and meet the encouragements given by ſeverall friends who heard ſome part of it as it was preached, preparatory to the Sacrament, in ſeverall Sermons, through whom I have thought God might ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:106805:7"/>2. To manifeſt that my ſetled thoughts have been upon, and ſerious ſtudies about this bleſſed Ordinance, which ought to be adminiſtred, though in the place where God for ſome time hath pitcht my Tent, for the want of neceſſary aſſiſtants, I have not known how actually to adminiſter the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To declare plainly my poor appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſo far as the Lord hath given me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the meet ſubject of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance, with the manner of its meet management; if ſo I might in ſome meaſure vindicate my ſelf, who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly ſuffered ſeverall waies, in the uncomfortable ceſſation of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To provoke the expedition of that way of government in all the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt (if under any ſuch eies this Treatiſe may fall as the diſpatch of that good work concerns) that ſo Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may ſafely and ſweetly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in this Supper of the Lord. An Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance by all Gods people earneſtly to be panted after. Its reported to be one of the three things <hi>Auſtin</hi> deſired to have ſeen, <hi>viz. Chriſt in the fleſh.</hi> O how ought we all to deſire to ſee Chriſt advanced on his Throne, and diſpenſed at his Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:106805:8"/>5. To diſcharge that duty wherein I look upon my ſelf obliged both in reſpect of my Miniſteriall calling, and in reſpect of the ſolemn covenant made with God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For my calling, it ingages me to uſe all good waies for the inſtruction of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now as people have two waies of learning, <hi>viz.</hi> by hearing and ſeeing: So Miniſters have two waies of teaching them; by propoſing truths to their ears in their Sermons, by preſenting truths to their eies, in their writings. I have oft ſpoke to the ears, I now once ſpeak to the eies, the Lord ever ſpeak to the hearts of his people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For my covenant, it bindes me in my place by all good means to endeavour, <hi>The reformation of Religion, in Doctrine, Worſhip and Diſcipline, according to the Word of God, and the example of the beſt reformed Churches:</hi> To the compaſſing of which good end, if this may be any means, I acknowledge mercy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To ſupply the want of ſome farre better Treatiſe that may referre to Church Diſcipline, as it is to be converſant about the right tranſaction of the Supper of the Lord: for though many excellent Tractates have been publiſhed, ſome whereof have
<pb facs="tcp:106805:8"/> poſitively aſſerted, and others polemically diſcuſſed. Many things requiſite to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, yet to the point of Church-Government as it concerns this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein ſome are to act, and others to ſubmit, I finde little extant, though I fear the caſting in of my poor mite, will adde no great matter.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To contribute my beſt aſſiſtance to compoſe preſent differences and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among Chriſtians, whereby they are rent one from another in opinion and communion; and could we accord in this one ſervice, to walk by one rule, and minde the ſame things, other diverſities would be ſoon reconciled.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To facilitate this great and difficult ſervice, when it ſhall come to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Congregations where it hath been long neglected (which I mention with a mourning ſpirit) the work may paſſe on the more ſmoothly, the way being cleared, ſcruples removed, helps preſcribed, the hearts of Gods people the better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to meet the Lord in this his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. All along which I have had ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſpect to the profit of the people among whom I am for the preſent placed, to whom ſome part hereof have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb facs="tcp:106805:9"/> preached; as the language toward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the later end ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To improve the ſhort time of my ſojourning, I have conſidered my weak body, and that I ſhall not ſpeak long, to children, friends, or Gods prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, which hath made me the more willing to get the winde, and take the ſeaſon, to leave ſome part of Goſpel-truth upon record for the benefit of Gods dear Saints. <hi>Ziſca</hi> deſired his skin might ſerve the <hi>Bohemians</hi> in their warres, when his body could no more doe it: O that I might leave ſomething to be ſerviceable to Gods Church when I am gon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus have I given an account of the reaſons ſwaying me to publiſh theſe things, wherein if the Lord ſhall accept of me, my ſoul rejoices, I ſhall adore free grace to be made an inſtrument of the
<pb facs="tcp:106805:9"/> leaſt good to any, however I have begged pardon in the bloud of his Son, for what ever errors or weakneſſes are found here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that may hinder the good ſucceſſe hereof; yet if poſſible I might attain thereto, I cannot but let this Treatiſe go forth, begging the bleſſing of heaven to go therewith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Touching this point I ſhall declare four waies. 1. How it is deducted. 2. How it is explained. 3. How it is confirmed. 4. How it is applied.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſhall make good the ground or bottom where upon this concluſion is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that you may ſee it hath firm footing, and foundation in the Text, for happily it may ſeem otherwiſe to ſome, becauſe Chriſts taking in of theſe Diſciples onely, and requiring them to partake in this Supper, is thought to be a thing meerly accidentall and caſuall, falling out at that time upon occaſion of the Paſſeover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that therefore from thence we can lay down no inſtruction for future.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, though we ſay in ſome ſence this was caſuall and accidentall, yet in ſome other reſpects more conſiderable, I am ſure it was not, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was not ſo in reſpect of the praevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and providence of God, to whom nothing is contingent, but it was ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and guided by the good purpoſe and pleaſure of God, that thoſe Diſciples and thoſe only ſhould then communicate.</p>

               <p>Secondly, Chriſt in that he admitted thoſe diſciples only to his Supper, did thereby declare theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That none for preſent that were not in ſome true ſenſe his diſciples had any right to his Supper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That none for future that ſhould not become his Diſciples ſhould ever be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted meet for this Supper.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Chriſt did hereby ſhew that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever now was no diſciple had no right to fit at that Table, wherefore though we ſhould ſuppoſe, if ſome others that were diſciples, had been then and there preſent, Chriſt would not have refuſed them, yet we muſt not ſuppoſe that if any had been preſent, who were in no ſence his diſciples, that he would have received them.</p>

                  </gap> ſhew that whoever ſhould not be his Diſciple for future, ſhould hence have no ground to plead for any part in this Supper: Chriſt by this action did entail the proper intereſt of this ordinance upon his Diſciples as

               <p>Secondly, Chriſts Diſciples they ſeek to ſettle themſelves firm in the words of Chriſt: <hi>If ye continue in my words, then are ye my Diſciples indeed,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31. As he is not a ſcholar in a ſchool who learns a leſſon and away, but he that abides at his book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither is he a Diſciple of Chriſt, who learns a little of Chriſt, and leaves it preſently, but he that learns and lives accordingly: Hence then
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106805:24"/> as not thoſe that are barrer, ſo not thoſe who are backſliding are any of Chriſts Diſciples indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.66. Chriſt had Diſciples that went with him a while, at length they went back from him: but ſuch were his Diſciples in pretence, not indeed. Thoſe who have ſeemed to come up to Chriſt, but now like the ſunne in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> daies they are gone many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees back, yea and their going on ſtill is as the reading of Hebrew altogether backward in every line of their lives, theſe are not the Diſciples of Chriſt indeed, nor ever were. Well then I hope by this time it is underſtood according to the rules of Chriſt, who are the true Diſciples of Chriſt, to whom appertains this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to partake in this Supper of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as love Chriſt above all, and love all others in Chriſt, they are fit to take this token of Chriſts love.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, To the third thing, which is for the confirming of the point, to prove, that this ordinance of the Lords Supper is for Chriſts diſciples alone.</p>
               <p>The ſincere ſervants of Chriſt who are ſanctified by Chriſt, and ſubject to Chriſt, are ſuch onely in the ſight of God, who are meet to communicate in this Supper of the Lord.</p>
               <p>To make this good, obſerve that there are things which referre to this Supper-Sacrament of two ſorts.</p>

               <p>The mercies deſcending, which are from God to man, from the Lord to the beleever. The duties aſcending, which are from man to God, from the beleever to the Lord. And theſe things are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined and involved, to wit the duties with the mercies, and the mercies with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106805:25"/> the duties: that as who ever performs the duty ſhall receive the mercy, ſo none can receive the mercy but who performs the duty.</p>
               <p>Now come to diſciples and non-diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, beleevers and unbeleevers, penitent Saints and impenitent ſinners, and thus falls the preſent caſe.</p>

               <p>Wicked men when they come to this repreſentation of Chriſts death, they do but dally with the death of Chriſt, deſpiſe it, diſgrace it, and as much as in them lie put Chriſt to death again, ſure ſuch muſt be hindered.</p>

The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment here lies in three degrees. 1. Weakneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt languiſhing of the body, and inclination to diſeaſes. 2.

Now of the two firſt degrees being the leſſer evils, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>many were weak and ſick:</hi> of the third, being the greater evil, to wit death, he alters the word in the Greek, and ſaith, not a few were dead, though not ſo many as were weak and ſick: it is likely all were not equall in this ſin, ſo not all equall in the puniſhment, though for that very ſin all in ſome degree puniſhed. For this cauſe many are weak and ſick among you, and not a few are aſleep.

God would not give out and lay forth the riches of his grace all at once, but by degrees for the greater glory of his name, and good of his people. Chriſtians muſt exceed Jews; as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel exceeds the law;<note place="margin">Qui ſcit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter legem &amp; Evangelium diſtinguere, gratias agat Deo &amp; ſciat ſe eſſe Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logum.</note> I would be loath to diminiſh the due honour of either.

               <p n="1">1. In the figurative part that ſhadowed out Chriſt to be crucified, and hereafter to die, whereas this is to repreſent Chriſt that is crucified, who hath already ſuffered the death of the croſſe, and is now advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the crown.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the memorative part, that was to remember them of a temporall deſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from bodily death, and the like: this is to put us in minde of our eternall ſalvation, and everlaſting deliverance from the death both of body and ſoul in hell, by the redeeming death of Chriſt once on earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the materiall part, At the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we read of bread eaten, but not of any wine drank. In that, the Jews they eat fleſh, but there was no bloud drunk, though bloud-ſhed,<note place="margin">Lex eſum ſanguinis prohibet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium praecipit ut bibatur. <hi>Cyp,</hi> de caena Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> but in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is two helps meet, both bread and wine, and here is not only the body of Chriſt to be eaten, but his bloud alſo to be drunk by a lively faith, In a word, every time a paſſeover was celebrated, there muſt bn a lamb ſlain by their hands, here is a lamb ſlain to our hands. Well this being more excellent, let us be the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106805:70"/> more diligent to preſerve this in its pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice purely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Yet from that Paſſeover there were ſome forbidden, ſure for ceremoniall uncleanneſſe ſome were kept back, <hi>Num.</hi> 9.7. and a rule was made in ſuch caſes for the time to come; that thoſe ſo unclean ſhould be kept back until the next month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſeover, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. that they might have time to cleanſe themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now as ceremoniall uncleanneſſe on the body, did figure out ſpirituall filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ſoul, by thought, word and deed;</p>
               <p>So that legall prohibition of perſons ceremonially unclean, from the Paſſeover, did repreſent that ſuch ought rather to be debarred who were known to be polluted with morall uncleanneſſe, and ſure left for our inſtruction upon record, to ſignifie ſuch filthy offenders ought to be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Lords Supper, wherein we are not to fall ſhort, but riſe higher then they in that old Paſſeover.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Script.</note>The ſecond Scripture is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.354.

Grant that this Manna and water was as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the Jews, and grant that our Sacrament of the Supper holds a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with the ſame. Hence (ſaies <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>) as thou eateſt the bread of the Lord, ſo did they Manna, and as thou drinkeſt the cup of the Lord, ſo did they water, to them God gave Manna and water, to thee he gives bread and wine, yea his body and bloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of reſolution. So Firſt, we ſay that Sacrament was temporary, and their participating extraordinary. It was temporary, not as the Paſſeover perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and to abide, but meerly tranſient at that ſeaſon, and ſo ceaſe: Now from a paſſing, flitting Sacrament, we cannot well take a ſtanding, binding Argument: And their partaking was extraordinary, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by their preſent extremity, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of bodily neceſſity, being in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, where they were in miſerable hunger and thirſt, and ſo were allowed to eat

               <p>This is a wrong key then and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver open the door to let in all to eat and drink at the Table of the Lord, But,</p>

They did all eat and drink, But with many of them God was not well pleaſed, for their carkaſes fell in the wilderneſſe: God was much diſpleaſed with them, not only in their perſons, but in that very action, they being ſinfull and carnall did only eat and drink in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way, and to a ſenſuall end to feed their bodies,<note place="margin">Qui in man na Chriſtum intellexerunt ſpiritualem cibum man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducarunt. <hi>Aug.</hi> de utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta panit. <gap reason="foreign">

It is memorable, God for the ſuſtaining and ſaving poor periſhing ſouls hath provided three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meals; A breakfaſt, a dinner, a ſupper. All may be but the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſetting forth Chriſt. The breakfaſt that is in the morning or beginning of the day, it is the leſſer, quicker, and ſhorter meal. This was that brief Evangelicall promiſe of Chriſt to lapſed <hi>Adam</hi> in the morning of the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Chriſt the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.8. The dinner at noon or midday, here the proviſion is uſually larger and diſhes fuller. In <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets more about the noon-time of the world, Evangelical diſcoveries and diſcourſes of Chriſt, are more perſpicuous and copious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. The Supper that is at the evening or end of the day, when the cheer in a feaſt is very full. 1. The Supper meal is the ſweet meal, in regard of the work of the day paſt, we then ceaſe from, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106805:80"/> of the reſt of the night to come, that we then ſoon lye down to. The Supper God hath now provided in the evening, or later end of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. This is ſweet and large in the plain and plentifull preaching of the Goſpel, and abundant powrings out of the ſpirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.17. Hard ſervitudes of former bondage and burdens, bleſſed be God, we are free from, there is a reſt we enjoy, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we are haſtning to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.9. 2. The Supper-meal is the laſt meal, no more after, then eat or never. Now is God ſending in his laſt meſſes of mercy, not another Chriſt to come, or Goſpel to preach, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. now feed or famiſh, this is the laſt meal. Its Supper, upon this God is earneſt, Chriſt is inſtant. The Lord cals firſt Jews, then Gentiles; firſt thoſe more neer in the ſtreets of the city, then ſends to them more remote, that lay as it were abroad in the high waies, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, rich and poor. God would have them compelled in, <hi>viz</hi> to the hearing of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106805:80"/> the laſt meal is ſerving in, yet how many plead excuſe from this Supper. O their oxen and farms, pleaſures and profits, they have no leaſure to look after what God in the Goſpel tenders. I remember it's ſtoried of. <hi>Henry</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> asking the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> if he had obſerved the Eclipſes, anſwered he had ſo much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe on earth, that he had no leaſure to look up to heaven. O ſad for men to be ſo bent on the buſineſſes of the world, as not to caſt up looks to the things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nay not to regard though the Lord brings heaven down to them, yet thus it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. men that minde not Chriſts Supper brought down in his Goſpel, ſhall they partake of the Lords Supper brought forth at his Table?</p>
               <p>A ſixt Scripture is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.<note place="margin">Script.</note> God would have all men to be ſaved: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would have all men to come to the Sacrament, as a means of ſalvation.</p>

               <p n="2">2. By vertue of ſomwhat to their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate parents, though in their practiſe perverſe and naught.</p>

In the chapter the Apoſtle proves the converſion of the Jews, againſt which it might be objected, O they be a vile and wicked people. Grant, In regard of their own ſinfull condition, they be miſerable: yet in regard of Gods covenant made with their progenitors, their eſtate is recoverable. For if the firſt fruits be holy, the lump is alſo holy, and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches. The Apoſtle compares the ancient Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks to the firſt fruits and root, not in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of their perſons, but in reſpect of the promiſe made to them and their ſeed, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> before, and <hi>Calvin</hi> after well expounds it. The lump and branches are their ſucceeding poſterities even to the preſent people of the Jews, to whom the covenant continues, with an entail not cut off, by reaſon of which they be called holy, and their caſe hopefull.</p>

                  <item>3. From the terms of converſion.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. If the Sacrament converts ſinners it muſt be by one of theſe two waies.</p>
               <p>Either as a naturall Agent, by an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent power; or, as a morall Inſtrument, by a derived power.</p>
               <p>The Sacrament ſure doth not cauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in a phyſicall way,<note place="margin">Cauſa in actis poſita impoſſibile eſt non ſequi effectum.</note> from its own vigorous nature and inherent power, for then when that cauſe is actually propoſed, ſuch an effect would be ordinarily produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as appears is not. No naturall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe, hath the effect going before, or long after. Converſion is before any Sacrament received in ſeverall, and in other they receive Sacraments, and yet the Lord knows, remain unconverted. Naturall cauſes and their effects do ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocate, as bring but forth the cauſe, and ſoon follows the effect. But ſo the Sacrament works not upon Saints, where there is no ſuch putting of bars, as may be conceived by ſinners, yet how oft is the effectuall benefit thereof from them ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended? they finde not the good a great while, yea it may be much of that they ſo much deſired, they meet not with, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106805:106"/> argues it hath no inherent power, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſe to act from it ſelf upon good, much leſſe can be lookt for upon bad. There is difference between a naturall and a morall Agent, God conveys power to a naturall Agent to doe its own action, ſo to work from an inward principle of it ſelf, as to bring forth ſuch effects as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereunto. This is not the caſe of the Sacrament: And as it hath not a power to work by way of inheſion, for the converſion of ſinners, ſo neither by way of diſpenſation or elevat on of God, to that uſe in its ordinary courſe, as it hath not a power to convert from an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute inherence, ſo neither as an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ordinance, ſet apart for that purpoſe. Second cauſes can effect nothing without the continued concourſe of God, the firſt cauſe, carrying them to tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It hath no derived power for that purpoſe, ſhould the Lord have meant it for this matter, he would have left ſome precept to injoin
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106805:106"/> the Miniſter to give, men to receive it for that end, ſome promiſe to accompany and encourage the uſe hereof for this cauſe: as he hath done for the word to diſpenſe and hear that, that thereby ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men may be converted and live, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Encline your ears, hear, and your ſoul ſhall live:</hi> Yea men for preſent dead in ſin, yet the Lord hath promiſed they ſhall hear his word and live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. The hour is, the dead ſhall hear the voice of Chriſt, and they that hear ſhall live, hence we have warrant to ſound the word of life in dead mens ears, but where is the warrant to put the bread of life into dead mens mouths that thereby they may convert and live?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Converſion for the kindes is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as we finde by its foot-ſteps in the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>A converſion from Gentiliſme to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>A converſion from the ſtate of nature to grace.</p>
               <p>The later is more then the former: The former converſion may be, and yet men never come to the later, as it were eaſie to inſtance from divers in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles daies, who though they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106805:107"/> from Paganiſme to Chriſtianiſme, yet were not converted from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, to a ſtate of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, now this converſion being the more excellent, it is the more difficult, yet if the Lords Supper be proper and prevalent to cauſe this converſion, which is the greater and rarer, why not apt and eaſie for to effect that converſion rather, which is lower and leſſer. Yet</p>
               <p n="1">1. If ſo, then how was it that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſending forth his diſciples to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert men to the Chriſtian faith, out of the Pagan world, did not appoint them to adminiſter his laſt Supper, as well as to preach the Goſpel, and baptize, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17, 18. God ſpeaking to <hi>Paul, I ſend thee to the Gentiles, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light,</hi> &amp;c. How? by giving to them the Sacrament of the Supper? No, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to them the doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If ſo, then were we to go to the Jews, Turks, Indians, to convert them to the faith of Chriſt, at our firſt entrance we were to adminiſter the Supper of Chriſt, as well as to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, that being a converti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>g ordinance,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:106805:107"/> and a way for the firſt gathering a Church, as well as this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The terms of converſion, are from ſin and ſatan, to God and Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. Now if the Lords Supper be ſet up in the Church to convert and turn men from ſin, to God, then when we finde men moſt deſperate in ſin, and diſtant from God, obſtinate in ſin, and moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to God; we ought to preſſe them, not only to take good counſel from the word, but to take bread and wine at the Table of the Lord, to deal with them in this as in that, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 2. <hi>I charge thee to Preach the word in ſeaſon, and out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that is, ſaith one, both to the willing and the unwilling. Yea, and ſo muſt we deliver the Lords Supper, urge it upon men, though no minde to it at all, if that it be as the word appointed for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, yea and may not the Chriſtian Magiſtrate go further? who in the Church, though he cannot force inward conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the faith, yet may compel to the outward means appointed for mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and ſo conſtrain people to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take at this Table.</p>
               <p>This then might colour that cuſtom and conſtitution to injoin all at 16. years
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:106805:108"/> of age, to receive the Sacrament: the thoughts of it makes my heart even quake, no doubt this hath been the damnation of divers. As the cruell Spani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But to conclude, if the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be a converting Ordinance, give the word whereby it is ordained to convert, for as it muſt have a word of Inſtitution, or it could never be a Sacrament, ſo it muſt have a word of Inſtitution for what it works as a Sacrament.</p>

               <p>Baptiſme is once adminiſtred, it being ſufficient we ere once new born. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper is oft celebrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we need frequent food. Baptiſme is a Sacrament more contract, the ſubject being capable of leſſer receipts. The Lords Supper is of a more enlarged compaſſe, the ſubject thereof having larger capacities, grace once received though at firſt but little widens, as it were the ſoul, and ſo is meet for more.</p>
               <p>Baptiſme hath but one ma in buſineſſe, the regenerating, waſhing, purging the ſoul from the ſtain of ſin, hereupon one ſign in this Sacrament ſufficeth, to wit water meet to intimate its main work.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe naturall men coming to the word, may poſſibly not be alway and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unprofitable hearers: whereas ſo oft as they come to the Lords Table they are certainly alway and altogether unworthy receivers: they hearing the word, though they do not gain ſo much good as we wiſh, yet they have ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, they are not converted, yet they are reſtrained, and in many things reformed, as <hi>Herod</hi> was by hearing of <hi>John,</hi> Mark. 6.20. they are not altogether wonne, yet they are oft almoſt perſwaded; as <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> was in hearing <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 26.28, 29. ſo its meet they hear ſtill.

               <p>Wicked men in that they receive the Sacrament unworthily, we may conclude they have often heard the word unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably.

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe in unworthy receiving the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106805:112"/> Sacrament greater mercy is abuſed then in unprofitable hearing of the word, and that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we reſpect the matter of mercy repreſented.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we reſpect the manner of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting mercy.</p>
               <p>The mercy repreſented in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the matter of it, is ſurpaſſing. The word proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord, the Sacrament iſſues out of the ſide of the Lord, neareſt his heart. In the word we have the ſayings of God. In the Sacrament the ſealings of God. In the word is the breath of Chriſt. In the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the bloud of Chriſt. In the word we have the love of God, in the voice of Chriſt. In the Sacrament the love of God in the croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The repreſenting of mercy in the Lords Supper, for the manner is very admirable beyond the way of the word.

               <p>And if Gods word warrants that to be adjudged viſible unworthineſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrable from the Table of the Lord, which ariſeth only from a privative cauſe, as want of wiſdome in a fool, or uſe of reaſon in a frantick man, then without doubt the word warrants our judging that to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unworthineſſe, and ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar from the Lords Table, which alſo proceeds from a poſitive cauſe, to wit, open evils in wicked men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods word yet gives forth its war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant more fully not to ſuffer ſuch ſinfull men to conſcience with us at the Supper of the Lord.</p>

               <p>If that which is objected be taken up all together, the main ſtrength lies in pleading cuſtome, thereby to warrant a univerſall admittance to this holy Ordinance, the weakneſſe of which ſhall be diſcovered from two cauſes.</p>

               <p>We finde how from a plea of cuſtome the pureneſſe of this precious Ordinance hath been wronged and corrupted in two reſpects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In reſpect of the Elements.</item>
                  <item>2. In reſpect of the communicants.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Upon this pretence ſuch things in this Supper for Elements have been taken up, and continued, as Chriſt never ordained. To inſtance in theſe hereticks of old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Aquarij,</hi> becauſe in the holy admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration they uſed water only, and no wine, which doing they upheld from a long cuſtome, <hi>Cyprian</hi> then alive wrote much againſt them, to refute the pooreneſſe of this plea, declaring how abſurd it was, when in reaſon they were overcome, to defend themſelves by urging the long cuſtome. Upon this pretence alſo ſuch perſons at this Supper for communicants have been taken in and continued, as Chriſt never intended.</p>
               <p>How common hath it been when ſuch daies and ſeaſons of the year have come. People meerly out of cuſtome have thought they muſt come to the Table of the Lord. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cries down ſuch ſenceleſſe conceits of ſeverall in his time.

               <p>If the time of lent, or day of Epiphany be come, they call to partake how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared ſoever they be.

               <p>Again where cuſtome is without truth, it is only an ancient errour, now this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome not alone deſtitute of, but oppoſite to truth, we may clearly conclude it. <hi>Tertullians</hi> ſaying is ſound and good.<note place="margin">Tertul. com.

               <p n="1">1. That which pertains to the Miniſters giving to all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which concerns the Miniſters receiving all.</p>
               <p>Miniſters herein under charge are of two ſorts. Some corrupt and vicious, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers godly and gratious. If we conſider, it is no marvell for Miniſters, ſcandalous and wicked themſelves, to admit wicked and ſcandalous men to the Sacrament. Had we had that <hi>clericalis diſciplina,</hi> which learned <hi>Bucer</hi> did ſo often call for in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. daies, it had preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much evil in this kinde: for want thereof, O the monſtrous miſcarriages that have been among many of this order, both in their perſonall and Miniſteriall places. To inſtance in this ſo black and blame-worthy the proſtituting holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries to prophane men, but ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters practice is a poor preſident to abide by in this buſineſſe. Come to Miniſters holy and good, unto whom this common coming of all to the Sacrament hath been the heavieſt burden on their backs, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106805:129"/> theſe I reduce to two ranks.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as after a while, have eaſed themſelves of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as have ſtood ſtil, and groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſore under it.</p>
               <p>Hereupon many Miniſters of pretious parts and ſpirits, that they might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of this load, have been brought to forſake, ſome the calling, others the Kingdom, and to bid a finall farwell to dear <hi>England;</hi> ventring Sea-voiages, to live in poor wilderneſſes, to paſſe through boiſterous windes and waves, to dwell among wilde beaſts, with many wants: Others that have ſtaied by it, how have they mourned under it, both to God and men! Hereupon at many a Sacrament, they have much ſtraitned their own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable communion with Chriſt, through the uncomfortable communion of others, this very ingredient hath imbittered the whole cordiall: how with troubled hearts and trembling hands have they dealt out the outward ſignes, with lamenting looks lifted up to God, beſides many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cries to heaven for help in this very thing! Yea and beyond what ſorrowfull mournings they have made to God, they have given faithfull warnings to men in
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106805:129"/> this matter, that they might take heed of ſinfull receiving. O what beſeeching with arguments, and denouncing of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtanding in the way of wicked men, with Gods word, as well as they might, to hinder their coming in to the crucifying of Chriſt, as the Angel of the Lord ſtood with a drawn ſword, in <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> way, to affright his going on, to the curſing of Iſrael. Yea ſome have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further in the preſent caſe, but how farre ſoever any with us have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted, it is now meet we all doe more, and be more exact in this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe theſe be times of ſorer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, when a Church or Kingdom is in trouble, the Lord looks ſome good ſhould be ſet up, that was not in it before ſeen, as when a woman is in travell, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her look for ſomewhat to be brought forth, that was not before born, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.6.12. we reade what a woe God pronounces againſt the city, that is as a boiling pot by reaſon of a great fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but yet the ſcum remains in.

Have we been beat with Gods rod, and yet not bow to Chriſts Scepter? It is reported of <hi>Groſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> once a Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> ſpeaking of the Diſcipline in the Primitive Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, againſt known offenders, calling them out to publike repentance, and caſting them out for incorrigible wickedneſſe: <hi>which diſcipline,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is not like to be let into this Land, unleſſe way for it be firſt cut by the blows of a bloudy ſword.</hi> A ſword of bloud hath cut and kild heaps upon heaps in this Kingdom, and yet are we awk to good waies: are not our necks ſtill ſtiff? who yeelds to the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe theſe be times of ſadder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, and thereupon ſinfull men are herein the leſſe ſufferable. We reade, <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. A houſe where the plague of leproſie was, if cureable, the courſe was for the Prieſt to command the plague ſtones to be taken away, and caſt out into
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:106805:130"/> an unclean place, without the city, and cauſe the houſe to be ſcraped round about, and the duſt ſcraped off to be poured out without the city, in an unclean place, <hi>verſ.</hi> 40, 41. But if the plague in a houſe were prevalent, and all the ſtones, morter, and timber were taken with it, it was to be all broken down, <hi>verſ.</hi> 45. This hath been the caſe of Churches and Kingdoms, in whom wickedneſſe hath been ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and wicked ones ſo abundant, as no way with them, but pulling down. O that we could ſee if any courſe for our cure by ſcraping off, and caſting out leprous and infected ones might yet be, leaſt we like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be utterly broken down. Chriſtian Churches who have held wicked men in their lap, God at length hath ſpewed them out of his mouth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.16. and becauſe they would not caſt out others, God hath caſt up them, and laid them like a filthy vomit on the ground never to be taken up, and it hath been indeed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that thoſe Chriſtian Churches, the Lord hath laid waſt for indulging wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have never been reſtored or made up again. The ſeven <hi>Aſian</hi> Churches that once were, are to this day a dreadfull inſtance.</p>

                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:106805:131"/>3. Becauſe theſe be times of brighter illuminations, and therefore it is meet to ſtand at a greater diſtance, with the works and workers of darkneſſe. More clarity requires more purity. Things good, the goodneſſe of them is more ſeen. Things evil, the evil of them is now more known. Whereupon it is meet we be more exact to embrace the one, and to refuſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Luk</hi> 15.8. <hi>What woman having loſt one piece of ſilver, doth not light a candle and ſweep the houſe,</hi> &amp;c. The houſe is the Church, the piece of ſilver loſt in the houſe, is impenitent ſinners living in the Church, the woman of the houſe, is the Paſtors of the Church, her lighting of the candle, is their preaching of the Goſpel to convert wicked men, the beſome with which ſhe ſweeps the houſe is that diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which they exerciſe in the Church towards open offenders: Now its meet when the candle is burning, the beſome ſhould be ſweeping. O that now both might be brought and ſet up in Gods houſe, the candle of clear doctrine, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the darkneſſe of ignorance, and the beſome of ſtrict diſcipline to ſweep out the duſt of prophaneneſſe, and ſo all clear and clean.</p>

Becauſe theſe be times of greater Reformation, not of looſer toleration; we are not to copy according to what hath been formerly looſe, but to labour the amendment of all heretofore amiſſe.

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the men they have been inflicted on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the matters they have been inflicted for.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that this bow hath been bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe arrows let fly at, were ſtill men moſt pious and zealous: carry on crows have been let come to the carkaſſe, when all the powder hath been ſpent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Doves and Pigeons,<note place="margin">Quid eſt quod Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae gladius, <hi>viz.</hi> Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio, extrabitur pro re nihili, ut pro re nummaria? <hi>Gerſ.</hi> lib. de Eccleſ. defec.</note> for ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, poor, pecuniary trifles forbid the Table of the Lord: as <hi>Gerſon</hi> complains, <hi>how in popiſh times the Eccleſiaſticall ſword was wont to be drawn for meer matters of nothing,</hi> &amp;c. So ſince hath it been againſt Gods deareſt ſervants, when the vileſt of the people have been fed with the bread of the Lord, and ought not this ſad abuſe to be reformed, and ſo cenſures reduced and reſtored to their Primitive purity? We may well conſider for things of this ſort,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106805:132"/> Their firſt formation, their deformation, and their reformation. The forming of all at firſt was fair, Church-orders and Ordinances right and regular, but O the foul deformities that have fallen in ſince, which to us cal aloud to labour a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, now the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. titles the time of the Goſpel, the time of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or the time of correction, as the Greek word ſignifies,<note place="margin">

               <p>To cloſe this part we plainly ſee, that however it hath been, yet now from the preſent ſeaſons there are preſſing reaſons why Miniſters ſhould manage this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-matter much more exactly then ever, to ſet up and keep up ſuch a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedge of holy diſcipline, as may keep off prophane men from defiling the holy things of God.</p>

If we admit whom we know unmeet to theſe holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, let us but think both what a great diſpleaſure, and great diſhonour it will be to Chriſt: diſpleaſing becauſe it will pervert his gracious purpoſe to his people to have this peculiar to them. A ſpeciall token of his love and care towards them above others he intended herein, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the way of Chriſts love to them in this is admirable, to feed them with his own bloud, and let others famiſh. We reade of a man condemned to ſtarve to death in a priſon,<note place="margin">Valer Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus. <hi>lib. 5.</hi>

I have read of <hi>Ingo</hi> an ancient King of the <hi>Draves</hi> and <hi>Veneds,</hi> who making a ſtately feaſt, appointed his Nobles, at that time Pagans, to ſit in the Hall below, and commanded certain poor Chriſtians to be brought up into his preſence Chamber, to ſit with him at his table, to eat and drink of his Kingly cheer, at which many wondering, he ſaid, <hi>he accounted Christians, though never ſo poor, a greater ornament at his table, and more worthy his company, then the greateſt Peers unconverted to the Chriſtian faith, for when theſe might be thrust down to hell, thoſe ſhould be his conſorts and fellow Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in heaven.</hi>

                  <hi>Fox,</hi> ſuch was his zeal and love to Chriſt, that he would never deny any beggar that ask'd him an alms for Chriſts ſake. This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing argument with God, be it with us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Nations ſake.

               <p>There were two things in the old world that brought the deſtroying floud. <hi>All fleſh had corrupted his way. The earth was filled with violence,</hi> Gen. 6. Corrupt in reſpect of Gods worſhip and ſervice depraved. Violent in reſpect of injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealing between man and man practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: to grow corrupt in Gods waies of worſhip, brings a floud. Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bede</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> reports that about the year of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106805:152"/> our Lord 420. The Brittons having been long afflicted by Iriſh, Picts, and Scots, God gave them great reſt, peace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as had not been heard, but they more then ever contemned his word, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Sacraments, not only the people vile, but the Miniſters very looſe in their converſations and miniſtrations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon came a plague that the living were ſcarce able to bury the dead: The Saxons of <hi>Germany</hi> who came firſt in for their help, broke out upon them in bloudſhed, drove them into a corner, and all this came, ſaith that reverend Author, for their hatefull ſins againſt Gods holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? may we not reade upon the forehead of the late bloudſheds, that have been in this Kingdom, the guilt of Chriſts bloud that lies upon this Land through ſinfull receiving the Sacrament? The judgements of God oft ſute to the ſins of men, that by the puniſhment we may know the offence. <hi>Joſephus</hi> reports that not long after the Jews had crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt on the croſſe, ſo many of them were condemned to be crucified, that there was not place enough for croſſes, nor croſſes enough for the bodies that were to be hung thereon. O let us herein
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106805:152"/> prevent Chriſts ſecond crucifying, not dealing out the Sacrament to ſuch as to doe it, will doe what in them lies. We reade the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the tranſportation of oil, wine, and pleaſant commodities to barbarous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leaſt they being drawn in, miſchiefs to the ſtate might follow. Let us not adminiſter bread and wine, ſuch precious things to prophane men, leaſt to the land worſe yet follows.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Churches ſake. To put out unmeet men at leaſt from the Table of the Lord, is the way to make the Church beautifull, healthfull and fruitfull. This defaced the glory of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. that having a head of gold, it had feet of clay and iron: Shall the Church have a bright head and black feet, will not this be a blemiſh? Let us make much of the gold, and not mix therewith iron and clay, this will be the Churches glory, honour, and health. Evil men, ſaith one, are in the Church, as ill humours are in the body, when they are purged out, the body recovers health and ſtrngth, is eaſed and refreſhed: So when ſuch men are put forth, and caſt out, the Church is much relieved and revived,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106805:153"/> becomes more able to bear and bring forth fruit unto God. The courſe God took with his Vineyard to make it fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 5. <hi>He fenced it, gathered out the ſtones, and planted it with the choiſeſt plants.</hi> Gods Church muſt have a fence, elſe every ſwine comes in: the ſcand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. State right the caſe of carnall men in this mighty and marvellous change, how wide the terms are aſunder, to bring from nature to grace, from death to life, wherein God uſually goes by degrees, as the ſubject whereon he works is made capable to receive his impreſſions, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.12. Men, the worſe they are, the longer ſetled in ſin, the more they oppoſe grace, and are croſſely indiſpoſed thereunto, the more ſlowly comes in and goes on the great work of God in the change of their eſtates.</p>
               <p>In naturall generations, the more vaſt the creature, the more ſlow the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an Elephant ten years in the womb, for a man grown up great and groſſe in ſin and wickedneſſe, yet to have ſuch a good change all of a ſuddain is a rare wonder.

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:106805:169"/> the grave he groans again, <hi>Lazarus</hi> comes not preſently forth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. and ſhall men who have lien many years rotting in their ſins, have ſuch a ſudden reſurrection? I remember a queſtion <hi>Auſtin</hi> propounds, whether they whom Chriſt ſhall finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live at the laſt day, ſhall not die at all, or in their paſſage to Chriſt in the air, die and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly live again? In anſwer he inclines to the latter, ſaying, ſuch have their death, and be again with a marvellous celerity revived, but this ſeems otherwiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. and ſo truly to think of men dead in their ſins, yet in the day of a Sacrament, with a ſudden celerity, to be made ſo alive by grace, as to meet Chriſt aright at his Table, is a miſtake.</p>

               <p>This diſcipline of Chriſt that concerns the Sacrament, let us purſue it, proſper it ſhall, though it goes on hardly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily a while, let us maintain our places, and keep our ground againſt ſinners, as the ſtarres in their courſes fought againſt <hi>Siſera.</hi> The cauſe is the Lords: The comfort will be ours: The good to Gods Church will be great.

               <p>And what I call you herein to conſider, I reduce to two heads.</p>

               <p>Firſt, Though you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>een moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet and unworthy, and therefore juſtly refuſed, yet uſing ſuch means, you not only poſſibly may, but certainly ſhall become ſo meet and worthy, as to be readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The Apoſtle firſt wrot to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to put away from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among them the inceſtuous perſon, and after wrot to them to receive him into their ſociety again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. being prepared by penitentiall workings, for that whereof he was before unworthy. It was the error of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, That ſuch as were caſt out of the Church for adultery or apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in times of perſecution were never to be reſtored:<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>lib</hi> 5. <hi>cont.

As there may be juſt cauſe for mens caſting out, ſo there may be cauſe as juſt for their taking in again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Though in the caſe of the Sacrament, you can by no means be meet or worthy in reſpect of a worthineſſe of
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:106805:200"/> adequation, yet there be waies whereby ye may be worthy, in reſpect of worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of approbation, ſuch is the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency of the Ordinance, you can never be abſolutely meet or worthy, yet you may be accepted ſo; meet and worthy in the account both of God and good men, and for this doe you ſtrive to be accounted worthy of the Sacrament of Chriſt as to be accounted worthy of the kingdom of God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though you may not by the means you uſe become immediately ſo meet and worthy, as ſome others are of this Ordinance, yet you may be ſo meet and worthy as to deal ſafely in this ſervice, as <hi>David</hi> had divers Worthies, and all did well in the warres, though ſome did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the reſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.19.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though ſome will not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the means, but remain unmeet and unworthy, yet if others of you will go the right way to work, you ſhall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, notwithſtanding as men meet and worthy; thoſe that will not, either they muſt be forbid, or approach at their own peril, while they are eating and drinking at the Table, they may expect an hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the wall, as appeared to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazar,</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:106805:201"/> when abuſing the veſſels of the Lord, with a <hi>Mene Mene Tekel,</hi> &amp;c. and better a power to forbid them, then this peril to abide them, plunging them into a perplexed poſture, how ever you ſhall be found to have ſo much weight and worth as to meet with a ſweet welcome at the Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Though you have had ſome trouble and ſorrow being caſt out for your unworthineſſe, the greater will be the joy and comfort, when you ſhall come ſo in, as to be accounted worthy. The prodigall out from his fathers houſe, was ſore afflicted, but O the meat, mirth and muſick that was made at his return, father and friends, they all rejoice: O the joy to Paſtor and people, upon your admittance, what think yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> will then be the comfort to you your ſelves? When the Sacrament to them that be in the gall of bitterneſſe, ſhall be as the bitterneſſe of gall, it ſhall be to you far ſweeter then the hony and the hony comb.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, Though the very means you are to uſe to be eſteemed meet and worthy at this Table, be very tedious, troubleſome, painfull and unpleaſing to the fleſh for preſent, yet the ſpirituall good you ſhall
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:106805:201"/> after gain, will abundantly recompence. I reade of one about to ſuffer martyrdom, putting one leg into the fire, cries, the fleſh ſhrinks and ſaies, <hi>Thou fool wilt thou burn and need not?</hi> the ſpirit anſwers, <hi>Hell fire is hotter, wilt thou venture that?</hi> The fleſh ſaith, <hi>Wilt thou leave thy friends?</hi> The ſpirit anſwers, <hi>Chriſt and his Saints ſociety is better,</hi> &amp;c. When you are about ſuch means as may make you meet for a Sacrament. The fleſh perhaps will ſay, <hi>Wilt thou put ſelf to ſhame, and ſin to death?</hi> The ſpirit may well anſwer, <hi>To eat and drink damnation is worſer,</hi> The fleſh ſay, <hi>Wilt thou forſake thy old luſts and lovers?</hi> The ſpirit may anſwer, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Christ and his members is better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was an excellent courage in <hi>Ignatius, I am the wheat that the teeth of beaſts muſt grinde, it matters not,</hi>

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:106805:216"/> as to want no Sacramentall ſupplies, or any communion-cordials, neither ſouls or bodies ſhall ever feel the leaſt hunger or thirſt there.

               <p>After the reſurrection, and in the ſtate of glorification, we ſhall not be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated out of hunger or thirſt to eat or drink, hunger and thirſt ſuppoſe a vacuity, emptineſſe, or abſence of what the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite deſires, and ſo a perplexity, trouble and pain to the party thereupon, which is not ſuteable to the full ſatisfactions and perfections of heaven, but pertinent to our indigent eſtate here on earth, while we are in this wilderneſſe world, we ſhall have our wilderneſſe-wants, as our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſo our ſouls will need their ſeverall meals.</p>
               <p>Every Chriſtian here is a traveller, his way may be rough, and his journey will be long from earth to heaven, from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to immortality, and ſo need of frequent refreſhments at the Table of the Lord.</p>

               <p>The Lords Table muſt be like <hi>Gideons</hi> Altar, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6.24. <hi>Jehovah-ſhalom,</hi> The God of love and peace, is there, and it becomes the people preſent, to be knit together in love and peace. The Lords

               <p>O let me in love admoniſh you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You do not truſt in, and reſt on the bare act of receiving the Sacrament, either with a reſt of confidence, or a reſt of contentation. It is the expreſſion of a precious man, <hi>A good work truſted in, is as mortall, as a ſin unrepented of,</hi> We are ordinary deſirous of, and perhaps diligent to prepare for a Sacrament; our thoughts are active, our hearts hot, and our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fervent at the Sacrament, and then we think all is well, the work is well done, and away we go. In the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. we read of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> came againſt them, they cried out to bring the Ark of the covenant into the field, and that ſhould ſave them, and when they had got the ark of the covenant into the camp, then they ſhouted, and in that they truſted but what follows? the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> fight, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for all that fly, and fall before them, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and ſo on: the ſtory is ſad, we conceive if this Sacrament of the covenant be brought into our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, then we ſhall be ſafe, and when we have this preſent amongſt us, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taked of by us, then we ſit down ſatisfied, and reſt contented, but the ſequel is ſad,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:106805:260"/> Thus to reſt in the ſervice prevents much good, and procures much evill.</p>
               <p>A twofold good is prevented.</p>
               <p>Hereby, neither the Sacrament after it, doth us that good, nor we do not that good after the Sacrament, as otherwiſe would.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites truſting in their bare view and looking upon the brazen ſerpent, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> a thing of nought: ſo if we truſt in our bare receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it will cauſe the Sacrament to become a <hi>Nehuſhtan,</hi> a thing not doing us any good.</p>
               <p>Hence we come to caſt by what would become us after the Sacrament: we doe not watch, and work, we do not after act upon a Sacrament, becauſe we reſt in the act of the Sacrament: yea there is much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hereupon: <hi>Moſes</hi> while he kept his rod in his hand, he did great things, but when he laid it by, it became a ſerpent: if we lay by the Sacrament, no marvell if it proves like a ſerpent, having a ſting following our neglect: O let as keep up the Sacrament in our hands and hearts, by a well improvement of it, and we ſhall do great things by it; now confidence in the firſt act, will cauſe negligence in the
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:106805:260"/> future, and therefore beware of that, truſt not to your bare being at the Sacrament, and then caſt conſequent care by.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As take heed of reſtings in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſo of rentings after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This alſo is very prejudiciall to the practice of ſubſequent obedience, the more firm and cloſe Chriſtian union is, the more apt and able we are both to do and ſuffer, the more ſweet and eaſy will both active and paſſive obedience prove: O then when by a ſacramentall bond we have been brought together, let us not after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and fall aſunder. All acts of religion ought to binde but no religious act like this.</p>
               <p>There are two things, the thoughts of which they are as weights that ſink, and as darts that ſtrike my very ſoul through and through.</p>

               </gap>n which it

            <p n="2">2. What is the place at which it is meet to be received.</p>
            <p>It is anſwered by propoſall of a double place.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Temple place.</item>
               <item>2. The Table place.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The place of the Temple, is the place in which the communion ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeived.</p>
            <p>The place at the Table, is the place at which this Communion is meet to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the place in which it ought to be adminiſtred and received, is the place of the Temple, or a Temple place: let none take offence at the phraſe.</p>
            <p>I paſſe by the ancient acceptation of the word, Temple, as we doe the word Prieſt. It's reported, that when the Prieſts of the Jews petitioned <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour for their lives,<note place="margin">Decet Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes cum templis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terire.</note> they had no anſwer but this, <hi>It is meet that the Prieſts and the Temple ſhould periſh together:</hi> and truly, in an ordinary ſenſe, as they lay before Chriſt among the Jews, ſo let the names of Temple and Prieſt periſh and be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten together.</p>
            <p>There is another interpretation of the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:106805:267"/> word Temple, that I take too, even as it referres to place, and I conceive the ſenſe is ſignificative.</p>
            <p>By a Temple place then, I mean an ample place,<note place="margin">Templum a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The receiving at the Table, is alſo moſt agreeable to the preſent practiſe of the beſt reformed Churches; as <hi>Scotland, New-England,</hi> and in all the pureſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of our preſent reforming-times this way is uſed. The Miniſter goes not up and down with the bread and wine in his hand, to finde out communicants ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about in their ſeverall ſeats, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and people together at the Table, he firſt receiving, then thoſe next him, and ſo the Elements handled from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Miniſter remaining in his place, the Elders by and about the Table, taking care that every one receive his part in his place. Thus in the Dutch and French Churches at this day; And what reſpect we ought to have to the pious patterns of reformed Churches, let us remember the firſt article of our Covenant.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This moſt agreeable to the late <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory,</hi> eſtabliſhed by Authority. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the communicants, to come and partake at, or about the Table, <hi>pag.</hi> 51. They may partake about it, yet at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from it; but they partake beſt at it, when cloſe about it, and when they partake both about it and at it, then
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:106805:276"/> both phraſes are obſerved. In the thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving directed this is to be acknowledged as a mercy, that by Chriſt we have liberty to eat and drink at his Table, <hi>pag.</hi> 53.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter being at the Table, is there not only to communicate himſelf, but there to break the bread, and give it to the Communicants; <hi>Take ye, eat ye,</hi> pag. 54.</p>
            <p>No direction to go up and down to ſpeak, and give to each individuall and particular perſon, remote from the Table.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This participating of people at the Table, is moſt agreeable to grounds of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and religion, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. This whole Euchariſticall ſervice,<note place="margin">Menſa haec ipſa anima noſtrae vis eſt, nervi mentis fiducia vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum, ſpes, ſalus, lux, vita no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, <hi>Chry,</hi> Ho. <hi>24. 1</hi> Cor. <hi>10</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The geſture that is thought to be moſt fitting is a Table-geſture; Now if at the Lords Supper it is moſt fit to uſe a Table-geſture, then it is moſt meet the geſture ſhould be uſed at the Table.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is a Symbolicall feaſt or ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, now how do men eat and drink at

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="5">5. This makes way for the more mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al comfort of all that communicate one in another, while they are thus it the Table together.</p>
            <p>As our ſight of the Elements at this Supper is meet, ſo our ſight of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants may be good and of good uſe.

            <p>Anciently, in the Fathers we finde, that it was a cuſtome in ſome Churches, for the people publikely <hi>to meet every day, and to have the word preacht, and this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament adminiſtred to them.</hi>

            <p>The people of God, <hi>Quoad jus,</hi> may have allwaies a right to receive, and yet <hi>Quoad factum,</hi> not at all times to exerciſe the act of receiving, but intervals and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions muſt be.

               </gap> ſome times, there may be ſome things that may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion longer interruptions in theſe Supper-adminiſtrations, then at other times. But I ſhall look upon things as they paſſe in
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:106805:280"/> the ordinary line of time.</p>
            <p>The particulars then that doe reſtrain and limit our actuall partaking at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Lord, that it is not ſo frequent as otherwaies it might, now follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our own perſonall indiſpoſedneſſe to this holy communion: Our fields are not alwaies in caſe to receive ſeed, they muſt have their conſtant courſe of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and ſometimes the husbandman ſees it meet to let his fields lie fallow for a while, that afterward, when they are ſowen, they may bring forth the fuller crops, and ſo truly our hearts are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in caſe for a Sacrament, they muſt have time for preparing, and it may be that great husbandman lets his ſervants a while lye as it were fallow from this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, that after, when they doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, they may finde the greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The unpreparedneſſe of other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we are to approach to this Table with; the Sacrament is to be a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church together, therefore it requires for thoſe we are to communicate with, ſome time for their preparation; ſuppoſe this or that particular Chriſtian, ſhould be kept in ſuch a holy frame, as to
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:106805:281"/> be ever fit for this precious ordinance, yet it may be otherwiſe with others, who yet are fellow members, and ſo ordinarily it is, and thereupon a ſtand.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Time is needfull, not only for all to prepare for the receiving of the Lords Supper, but for all to improve the Lords Supper after it is received, time after to digeſt it, and draw out the ſtrength of it. There are ſubſequent duties when the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:106805:281"/> is received, that are not inſtantly diſpatched: There is a ſecret vertue in the Sacrament that is not preſently perceived, There is Worth, Warmth, and Strength, that is not ſuddenly diſcovered, and that which is found is fit to be laid forth, to the glory of God, and praiſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p n="2">2. We are ſubject, when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is oft celebrated, to abate in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of it, and affections to it; upon long delaies, our deſires to it have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whenas by frequent receits, our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems of it have diminiſhed. The ſun in the firmament is a glorious creature, yet
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:106805:282"/> becauſe we ſee it commonly, we admire it not. Manna at firſt to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was a rare thing, but when it was common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, they ſoon loathed it: This ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is very excellent, let us ſo uſe it as we may ſtill prize it, and though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alway have it preſent in fact, yet let us alway make it preſent by faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the time of the day wherein the Lords Supper is to be received.</p>
            <p>The exact time of the day wherein this ordinance ought to be adminiſtred and received, I will not undertake to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: So farre as I ſhall diſcuſſe of time in this reſpect, ſhall be to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The time of the day wherein it was firſt inſtituted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The time of the day wherein it was after exerciſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The time of the day wherein it is now accuſtomed.</p>
            <p>The time of the day wherein the Lords Supper was firſt of all inſtituted,<note place="margin">Lombard. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 8. Aug. <hi>ep.</hi> 118. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</note> was the evening, that is the later part of the day, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.20. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.17. <hi>Now when the evening was come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If any enquire, why Chriſt inſtituted this his laſt Supper in the evening of the day. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:106805:283"/>1. Becauſe it could not be done ſooner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it could not be delaid longer.</p>
            <p>Not ſooner, becauſe the Paſſeover muſt be aboliſhed, before this Supper be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, or elſe there ſhould be two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the ſame uſe at the ſame time, now it muſt be the evening before a period could be put to the Paſſeover.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Paſſeover was not to be abrogated but at the time when it was to be celebrated, and that was not untill the evening, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.6. <hi>The whole aſſembly of the congregation of Iſrael ſhall kill it in the evening, and eat unleaven bread at the even, verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the Paſſeover was not to be aboliſhed till Chriſt the true Paſchal Lamb was near to be ſacrificed. When the time came that that was to be fulfilled in the ſubſtance which was repreſented in the ſhadow, then, and not before, was the ſhadow to vaniſh: and this evening that hour was at hand, for tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> night was Chriſt betraied into the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſo begun his ſad ſufferings.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee whereupon Chriſt could not inſtitute his Supper ſooner then this evening when he did it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="533" facs="tcp:106805:283"/>2. Conſider he could not delay it any longer then that evening.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe this evening the Paſſeover being abrogated, the Supper muſt then (as its ſucceſſour) be immediately inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, that there might be no intervall or empty ſpace when the Church and people of God were without ſuch a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the night following Chriſt was taken away from his diſciples, and delivered into the hands of his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſo the evening before he muſt doe this with his diſciples or never; and it was needfull for them that Chriſt ſhould then leave them ſuch a remembrance of his preſence, token of his love, teſtimony of his care, ſeal of his covenant, and ſuch a cordiall to preſerve their ſpirits in all their approaching perplexities.</p>
            <p>To conclude this then, when Chriſts paſſion ſo nearly approached, this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a repreſentation of his paſſion, was to be appointed.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the time of the day wherein the Lords Supper was at the firſt inſtituted with the cauſes thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve the time of the day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was afterward practiſed.</p>
            <pb n="534" facs="tcp:106805:284"/>
            <p>For the time of the day afterward, I finde that the primitive Chriſtians did not keep conſtant punctually to the ſame time, but ſometime they celebrated the Lords Supper in the former part of the day, and ſometimes in the later; ſometimes upon daies they were ſooner, and ſometimes later: ſometime they took the morning, and ſometimes the evening, and ſome daies both: and there were three things that occaſioned the ſet time to be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>

            </list>
            <p>The order and cuſtom of Churches in ſeverall places and ages made this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſo various. In many of the Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Churches, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reports, in his time the Chriſtians were wont to ſpend the whole day, in faſting, praying, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſinging of Pſalmes, and then at night, ſupping together, they celebrated after all the Sacrament, in imitation of Chriſt, and ſo departed.</p>

            <p n="3">3 To expreſſe our ardent love to Chriſt: The two <hi>Maries,</hi> ſuch was the ſtrength of their affection to Chriſt, that <hi>early in the morning, they come to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre where Chriſt was laid,</hi> Mark. 16.2. Love will bring us out as ſoon in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day as may be to meet Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To diſcover our courage for Chriſt, when we doe not as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> delay and come to Chriſt by night, but early and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in the day; to ſhew we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed nor afraid in open view to own Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To declare our care, firſt to ſerve the Lord Chriſt, and then our ſelves: It is ſaid of ſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. <hi>They ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies;</hi> they preferre the filling of their bellies before the ſervice of Chriſt. We let better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from us in this very buſineſſe, in that
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:106805:286"/> we ſee that Chriſt be ſerved before our bellies be filled, and that we minde our ſouls before our bodies, and the meat that endures, before that which periſheth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. Not that I think it unlawfull to eat any thing before we receive the Lords Supper, but ſure when our bodies are fed with a full meal, our ſouls may be found more unfit for holy ſervices.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For this ſervice in the day of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcharge, we take the former part, becauſe it is the freſher part, when we are more dexterous and ready, more vigorous and lively, more active and able to high and holy imploiments: ordinarily when night comes, and after ſupper, we are more meet for bodily reſt in the bed, then for any ſoul ſervice at the board.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, Such are our innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iniquities, frequent failings, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold miſcarriages even in all holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that our laſt work in the beſt day had need be repentance. If our praier in the morning be, <hi>Lord, Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> our praier in the evening had need be, <hi>Lord, Forgive us this day our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to enlarge the thing in hand no further, you ſee what time it is wherein
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:106805:286"/> we celebrate the Lords Supper, and how meet it is to have and hold that time, to wit, the former part of the day. If any ſhall object,</p>

            <p>Chriſt adminiſtred this his laſt Supper at night, or in the evening, but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no myſtery in it, nor mandate for it, that individuall act is not obligatory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this was grounded upon ſuch reaſons, as to him were urgent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but are not ſo to us: We have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the occaſion of Chriſts approaching departure to require it, nor his leaving it

            <p>Chriſt did this in the evening, after the Paſſeover, to ſignifie the aboliſhing, both of the Paſſeover and the evening, and ſo to leave the time free for h s Church and people afterward, to diſpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. We call it by the name of Supper, becauſe Chriſt ordained it at his laſt Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
